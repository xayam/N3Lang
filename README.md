# Language N3Lang and N3C archivator

N3Lang is an experimental language based on threebit supersymmetry; 
basic language operations have three inputs and three outputs. 
A program consists of a finite sequence of such instructions.
More details in file "/doc/N3Doc.pdf"

Now I'm making an archivator N3C based on these ideas. 
More details in the folder "/tests/" , 
in files test_?.py and test_?.txt and:
- "/n3lang/n3compressor.py" ,
- "/n3lang/n3c.py

If you can help with this, please join in.

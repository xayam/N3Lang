# N3Lang

N3Lang is an experimental language based on threebit supersymmetry; 
basic language operations have three inputs and three outputs. 
A program consists of a finite sequence of such instructions.

More details in file "/doc/N3Doc.pdf"

Now I'm making an archivator based on these ideas. 
More details in the folder "/n3lang" , in files:

- "/n3lang/n3compressor.py" ,
- "/n3lang/n3cstat.py" , output in "/n3lang/n3cstat.txt"

If you can help with this, please join in.
